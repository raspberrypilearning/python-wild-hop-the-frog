# Mentor Notes: Hop the Frog

## Project Overview

In this Python Wild project, learners use the p5 library to build a cartoon frog that hops into the air and stretches mid-jump. They practise drawing, animation, and interactive behaviours using Python code.

---

## What Learners Will Practise

- Drawing with `ellipse()` and `circle()`
- Using variables to animate motion
- Handling mouse input with `mouse_pressed()`
- Stretching and squashing shapes with logic
- Coordinating motion with gravity and state tracking

---

## Teaching Tips

- Reinforce that `draw()` runs like a loop — it repeats automatically
- Use simple language for motion and animation (e.g. “gravity pulls the frog down”)
- Emphasise that `x` and `y` are reused for positioning every part of the frog
- Explain that `stretch` is used to change multiple shapes with one variable

---

## Extension Ideas

- Add a bug to catch with the tongue
- Give the frog a crown, cheeks, or animated arms
- Add lily pads or water splashes in the background
